The classic OOP pattern usually called encapsulation implemented in ruby with <code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> <del>keywords</del> methods. The distinction between API and implementation works great with both. The problem is that <code>private</code> doesn't hide method for inherited classes.

<hr/>
See the simple example below:

<pre><code>
class A
  private
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end

class B < A
  def api
    implementation
  end
end

B.new.api
</code></pre>

And we won't get exception at the last line.<br/>
So, in fact <code>private</code> do not do what you expect it to do. Use cases that distinguish <code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> are more specific.
At first: <code>implementation</code> method can not be called like <code>self.implementation</code> even from class A.
<pre><code>class A
  def api
    self.implementation #exception here
  end
  private
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end

A.new.api
</code></pre>
Seamless pure gap. You can do such call if the method would be protected. Can't imagine the case when this limitation is useful. <br/>
<br/>
The second difference is a bit esoteric. Two instances of the same class can access protected methods of each other but not private methods.

<pre><code>class A
  def api(another) #suppose to receive an instance of a
    implementation == another.implementation
  end
  protected
  def implementation
    puts 'private A'
  end
end
A.new.api(A.new)
</code></pre>

Fine for <code>protected</code> but fail for <code>private</code>. Well, this kind of protection do not make a real because of it's rareness.
<h3>My conclusion: don't use private at all</h3>

You might do any decision on the points above.<br/>
My conclusion is to not use <code>private</code> at all, because it doesn't give the level of privacy that I expect. Difference form <code>protected</code> is so pure that it do not have any real benefits.
