Developing sites for communities you never join, enterprise applications for company you never work in, services you never find useful... a serious problem of IT industry. All misunderstanding between customers and developers come from that reason.
<br/><br/>
It would be so great if we could always feel ourselves as a user of our applications and make  something useful, but not spend time on improving features that won't be familiar. Being a user of the developed application makes it really possible to develop ergonomic and pretty design.
<br/><br/>
Unfortunately most of the companies are ignoring that simple rule and unfortunately in some cases it is hard to follow. But anyway that is the only one way to build the best product.
