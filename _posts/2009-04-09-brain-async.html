Many people came to the question: Why do our brain is having so many gaps: forget important info, quickly change opinion, stuck when doing usual actions, etc? Well, try to look from the different side.<br/>
Our brain is about 4 million of neurons('processors') that works completely async: neural impulses follow though brain without any rules and permissions, every neuron process the information in there own way, no body is able to re implement such a large information processing system. From this point of gap are normal and true solutions and that is being solved by our brain every day is a miracle.
