All of us are using passwords and most of us are typing them several times a day. And everyone knows the criteria to generate a good password. Random passwords are very strong from protection point of view but not from usability point of view. 
No body think about password unforgettable-ness and less-painful-to-type-ness. I saw many passwords that are very painful because they are just random. 

And I think it's nice to lose some randomness and make it easier to type and remember.
There is still a lot of enough strong passwords that match this criteria as well.

Try to type and remember something like:
<pre><code>sudosuamigo1;
s3host-large
you&me2gether</code></pre>
Instead of:
<pre><code>1aWhuyZ
!nzu?Us0
n]1m!uaA</code></pre>
 
And you feel much better.
