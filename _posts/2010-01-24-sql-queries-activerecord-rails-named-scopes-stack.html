If you ever work with rails application that is a little bit more complex then a simple CRUD you would know that some of the ActiveRecord magic doesn't work for complex SQL queries. I am primary talking about named scopes stack feature.<br/>
<!--more-->
<hr/>
Let's review the following named_scope that suppose to be usable in different combinations with others:
<pre><code>named_scope :network_of, lambda {|user|
{
:select =&gt; "u.*"
:from =&gt; "users u, followings f1, followings f2",
:conditions =&gt; "f1.follower_id = #{user.id} AND " + 
"f1.followed_id = f2.follower_id AND " +
"f2.followed_id = u.id"
}</code></pre>
It suppose to returns all people that are followed by people that are followed by the given person.
From the SQL point of view that is the simpliest and fastest way to do that with a plain SQL.
But this solution will have some issues with Active Record named scopes stack magic.
See that User.network_for(current_user).all(:limit =>5) will result in SQL exception primary because (:limit => 5) doesn't know about the table alias "users u".
We can not use it in fact.<br/>
The second problem comes to the foreground when we will try to use ActiveRecord features like
User.network_for(current_user).all(:include => :orders). ActiveRecord handles :include in the very different ways and in some cases you will see the SQL exception here as well.<br/>
The problem is that :include sometimes appends some joins to the query that is concatenated to the last table in the :from parameter. To solve that we should make "users" table to be the last one declared in :from parameter.
<pre><code>:select => "users.*"
:from => "followings f1, followings f2, users",
:conditions => "f1.follower_id = #{user.id} AND " + 
"f1.followed_id = f2.follower_id AND " +
"f2.followed_id = users.id"</code></pre>
Summary I would say that using :joins instead of :from/:conditions would give more flexibility and stackability to your named scopes but sometimes :from is more clear and here you got the tip how to use it.
