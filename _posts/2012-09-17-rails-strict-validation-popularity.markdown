It's nice to see that [strict validation feature](/2012/01/rails-32-features-changelog/#strict_validation_concept) that I've [done almost a year ago](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8620bf90c5e486e1ec44b9aabb63f8c848668ed2) is [finally getting popular](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/31728620503/refactoring-replace-conditional-with-polymorphism). Spend a moment and understand what it does by [Rails documentation](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-validates-21).
