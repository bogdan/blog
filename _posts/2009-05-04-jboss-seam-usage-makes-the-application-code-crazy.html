Seam Application has a number of good innovations but let's find out if we lose some advantages that we had before. I started application development with JBoss Seam one year ago. With the code base growth I have had more and more problems in workflow development .

I noticed that there are many problems which we have not had before, for example: 
<ul>
	<li>Utility methods calls are not straight and clear now.</li>
	<li>Find all usages IDE has feature became useless because of mass EL calls.</li>
	<li>There is much of the meta programming in such a severe OOP language as Java.</li>
	<li>It is impossible to debug JSF templates</li>
	<li>Seam Exceptions look so unclear.</li>
</ul>

Programming with Seam has all disadvantages of script languages like PHP or Ruby.
 I definitely admit that some features like Conversations and Native AJAX support made a big step forward. There is a lot of information in the net about How cool is seam but I tried to reveal the underside.<br/>

Think twice before switching to Seam.
